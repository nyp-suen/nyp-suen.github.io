            <h1> Recommendations </h1>
            <p> The Singapore's Ministry of Health (Health Promotion Board) has a list of dietary guidelines for
              beginners to follow when eating. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Eat a Balanced Diet: HPB recommends consuming a variety of foods from different food groups to ensure
                a balanced intake of nutrients.</li>
              <li>Fruits and Vegetables: Aim for at least 2 servings of fruits and 2 servings of vegetables daily.
                Choose a variety of colors to ensure a range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</li>
              <li>Whole Grains: Opt for whole grain options such as brown rice, wholemeal bread, and oats to provide
                fiber, vitamins, and minerals.</li>
              <li>Protein Sources: Include lean meats, fish, eggs, tofu, and legumes in your diet. These provide
                essential amino acids for muscle repair and growth.</li>
              <li>Healthy Fats: Choose sources of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and plant oils like olive
                oil. Limit saturated fats and avoid trans fats as much as possible.</li>
              <li>Limit Sugar and Salt Intake: Reduce consumption of sugary beverages, snacks, and desserts. Choose
                foods that are lower in sugar content and opt for unsweetened beverages or water whenever possible.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h2> Calories Intake </h2>
            <p>
              Calories (kcal) are the units of measurement for energy stored in the food and in your body. For weight
              loss to happen,
              your energy intake has to be lower than the energy you exerted out in a day.
            </p>
            <p>Weight Loss: <b>Calories Intake &lt; Calorie Loss</b></p>
            <p> Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating. Eating smaller portions helps maintain a healthy weight
              and prevents excessive calorie intake.</p>
