                    The Aston Martin Vantage is a series of hand built sports cars from the British
                    automotive manufacturer Aston Martin. The "Vantage" name was used by them to label
                    high-performance variants of their existing GT(Grand Tourer) models. The modern car
                    is the leanest and most agile car in Aston's lineup, as it is intended to reach out
                    to potential purchasers of exotic sports and GT cars.

                    Production of the V8(2005-2017) Vantage ended in 2017. The 2005 Vantage and its
                    variants became the most successful model in Aston Martin's history. The production version
                    of the car was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 2005. The v8 Aston Martin is a two-seat
                    two-door coupé and had a bonded aluminium structure for strength and lightness. The 4.38m
                    long car featured a hatchback-style tailgate which was both practical and had a large luggage
                    shelf behind the seats.

                    The v8 Aston Martin Vantage had many variants, some including the V8 Vantage Coupé,
                    v8 Vantage Roadster, v8 Vantage S Coupé, v8 Vantage S Roadster and many more. This 2005 model of the car
                    can still be found in many places, even in Singapore, although only second hand ones as production
                    had ceased a long time ago. The retail price of the car went for US$110,000, or $150,000 in SGD.
                    The second hand cars in Singapore however, go for about $350,000 to $600,000 normally.
