                <h1>Physical Characteristic</h1>
                <p>
                    The bearded dragon lives up to its name: Like a dragon, it’s equipped with armor of spiny reptilian
                    scales, which include a “beard” of spikes under its chin that puffs up depending on its mood. There
                    are eight species species of bearded dragons recognized today, all of which are affectionately
                    called “beardies.”
                    <br>
                    Among the most popular pet reptiles, bearded dragons tend to be gentle, inquisitive, and active
                    during the day. The central bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps, is the most common species to have as
                    a pet.

                <h1>Habitat</h1>
                <p>
                    In the wild, bearded dragons’ range extends across most of Australia. They typically prefer to stick
                    to warm, arid areas: deserts, subtropical woodlands, savannas, and scrublands. In the 1960s,
                    Australia banned the export of wild bearded dragons; however, they’ve been bred in the United States
                    for decades for the pet trade, and they come in a variety of color “morphs” not commonly found in
                    the wild.
                    <br>
                    A warm habitat is crucial for bearded dragons. They’re cold-blooded and rely on external heat
                    sources to raise their body temperature, which varies according to the temperature of their
                    environment. They bask in the sun to warm themselves and can burrow underground to avoid extreme
                    heat and predators. They’re semi-arboreal and often can be found on fence posts and tree branches.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h1>Diet</h1>
                <p>
                    Bearded dragons are not picky eaters. With their strong jaws, they can clench and crush
                    hard-shelled insects like beetles. As omnivores, they’ll also go for leaves, flowers, fruit, and the
                    occasional small lizard or rodent.
                    <br>

                </p>
                <hr>
                <h1>Behaviour</h1>
                <p>
                    Known for being territorial, adult bearded dragons may display their aggression to defend their turf
                    from other males, fight for food, or compete for a female. Some males may also attack females if
                    they don’t show submissive behavior.
                    <br>
                    The beard, which both males and females have, is an important way the lizards communicate. When
                    threatened, a bearded dragon will open its mouth, raise its chin, and puff out its beard to make
                    itself appear bigger. This display may also be accompanied by a hiss.
                    <br>
                    Bearded dragons also communicate by changing the color of their beards and bobbing their heads. A
                    quick head bob may signal dominance, whereas a slow bob and an arm wave is a sign of submission.
                    <br>
                    With a change of seasons, some bearded dragons may go through brumation, a type of hibernation, in
                    which they stop eating and only drink water sporadically. This dormant phase usually occurs in the
                    fall or winter as the light changes and temperatures drop.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h1>Health and Lifespan</h1>
                <p>
                    With proper care, bearded dragons can live for 8 to 12 years in captivity.
                    Common health problems include metabolic bone disease, respiratory infections, and parasites.
                    Regular veterinary care and proper husbandry practices can help prevent these issues.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h1>Courtship and breeding</h1>
                <p>
                    To catch the attention of a female, a male bearded dragon embarks on a showy ritual of courtship,
                    pounding his feet into the ground and waving his arms and bobbing his head. The male will pursue the
                    female and bite the back of her neck when mating.
                    <br>
                    Female bearded dragons are believed to have the unusual capacity to store sperm, which enables some
                    to lay two separate clutches of 11 to 30 eggs from a single mating.
                    <br>
                    The sex of bearded dragon embryos can be changed by the incubation temperature. If the temperature
                    is unusually high while embryos with male chromosomes are developing, they will instead develop as
                    females. Warmer temperatures during development also make bearded dragons slower learners.

                <h1>Early Discovery and Classification</h1>
                <p>
                    Bearded dragons were first described scientifically in the early 20th century. The central bearded
                    dragon, Pogona vitticeps, was described by German zoologist Ernst Ahl in 1926.
                    <br>
                    The bearded dragon belongs to the genus Pogona, which includes several species. They are part of the
                    Agamidae family, which encompasses a diverse group of lizards found in various parts of the world.

                <h1>Introduction to the Pet Trade</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>1960s-1970s: </b>Bearded dragons began to be recognized for their calm demeanor and relatively
                    easy care
                    compared to other reptiles, making them suitable pets. However, they were not widely available
                    outside of Australia due to strict export laws.
                    <br>
                    <b>1980s: </b>Bearded dragons were introduced to the international pet trade, particularly in the
                    United
                    States and Europe, after captive breeding programs were established. These programs helped reduce
                    the need for wild-caught specimens and contributed to their popularity as pets.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h1>Popularity as Pets</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>1990s-Present: </b>Bearded dragons have become one of the most popular reptile pets worldwide.
                    Their
                    docile nature, ease of care, and interactive behaviors make them a favorite among reptile
                    enthusiasts. They are also relatively hardy, adaptable, and have a longer lifespan compared to many
                    other reptile species.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h1>Scientific Research</h1>
                <p>
                    Bearded dragons have been subjects of various behavioral studies due to their unique social
                    behaviors, including arm waving, head bobbing, and beard puffing. Researchers study these behaviors
                    to understand reptilian communication and social structures.
                    <br>
                    Scientists have also used bearded dragons to study thermoregulation, metabolism, and reproduction in
                    reptiles. Their ability to thrive in a range of temperatures and their oviparous nature (egg-laying)
                    make them suitable for these studies.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h1>Cultural Impact</h1>
                <p>
                    Bearded dragons frequently appear in educational programs, documentaries, and media aimed at
                    promoting reptile conservation and education. Their approachable appearance and interesting
                    behaviors make them excellent ambassadors for reptile awareness.

                <p>
                    <b>Tank Size: </b>For an adult bearded dragon, a tank of at least 40-50 gallons is recommended.
                    Larger tanks (75-120 gallons) are even better for giving them ample space.
                    <br>
                    <b>Substrate: </b>Use reptile carpet, paper towels, or tile. Avoid loose substrates like sand, as
                    they can cause impaction if ingested.
                    <br>
                    <b>Temperature and Lighting: </b>
                    <br>
                    <b>Basking Spot: </b>Maintain a basking spot temperature of 95-110°F.
                    <br>
                    <b>Cool Side: </b>The cooler side of the tank should be around 75-85°F.
                    <br>
                    <b>Night Time: </b>Keep temperatures between 65-75°F at night.
                    <br>
                    <b>UVB Lighting: </b>Provide UVB light for 10-12 hours a day to help with calcium absorption and
                    prevent metabolic bone disease. Replace the UVB bulb every 6-12 months.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <p>
                    <b>Insects: </b>: Offer a variety of insects like crickets, dubia roaches, and mealworms. Younger
                    dragons require more protein, so feed them insects daily.
                    <br>
                    <b>Vegetables: </b>Provide leafy greens such as collard greens, mustard greens, and dandelion
                    greens. Other vegetables like squash and bell peppers can also be included.
                    <br>
                    <b>Fruits: </b>Offer fruits like blueberries, strawberries, and apples occasionally as treats.
                    <br>
                    <b>Supplements: </b>Dust insects with calcium powder 3-5 times a week and a multivitamin powder once
                    a week.

                            <b>Beard: </b>While human beards might be fashion statements, bearded dragons use their
                            beards to communicate. When threatened, bearded dragons puff out their beards to appear
                            larger to predators. Their beard color changes too, switching from white to black while
                            socializing.

                            <b>Eyes: </b>Bearded Dragons have three eyes, their two primary eyes see images, just like
                            our eyes. Their parietal eye, located on the top of their head, doesn’t see images but is an
                            optical lobe on the top of their head that can sense shadows and changes in light.
