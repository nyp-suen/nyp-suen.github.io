                The Central Processing Unit (CPU) follows instructions and
                decides when data should be stored, received
                or transmitted by different parts of the
                computer (including the ALU). This unit makes
                sure that data is transported to where it
                needs to be, and that it is processed in the
                correct order.

                The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) processes
                data by performing basic mathematical and
                logical operations such as addition,
                subtraction, multiplication and division.
                This unit performs the actual work of
                performing calculations and transforming data.

                Random Access Memory (RAM) or main memory
                is where data and instructions are stored
                temporarily so that they can be quickly accessed
                by the processor when needed. For instance,
                when an application is started, its instructions may be loaded into RAM. Data stored on
                RAM can be easily changed and is also volatile, which means that it is lost once the power
                supply to the computer is interrupted.

                The Data Bus transports data that is going to
                be processed to the CPU, as well as data that
                has already been processed from the CPU.
                The Data Bus is bi-directional because data
                can be sent in both directions between the
                processor and memory.

            <div class="bottom" id="abb">
                The Address Bus specifies memory address
                information. When the processor reads
                from or writes to memory (RAM), the
                relevant address information is provided
                on the address bus. The Address Bus is
                uni-directional because address information
                is always sent in one direction only, that is,
                from the processor to memory.
