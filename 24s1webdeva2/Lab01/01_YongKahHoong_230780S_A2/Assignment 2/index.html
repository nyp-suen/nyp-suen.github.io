            <p class="centered">The first atomic bomb ever produced was by the Manhattan Project.
                First started in December 1941, it was a research and development program led by the US in collaboration with Canada and the UK with the aim to develop nuclear weapons before Nazi Germany.

            <P class="centered">
                At its peak, the Manhattan Project employed nearly 130 thousand people, costing a modern equivalent of $27 Billion USD (in 2023).
                More than 80% of the 
                 came from building and operating plants that produced the fissile material, and more than 30 research sites were built across the US, Canada and the UK.

            <p> 
                The "Little Boy" Bomb was a gun-type fission weapon which used Uranium-235.
                It was reworked from a previous bomb called "Thin Man", which was also a gun-type fission weapon but proved impractical as it used plutonium-239.
                The "Little Boy" was developed by Los Alamos Laboratory and its components were fabricated at 3 different plants to prevent anyone from having the complete design.
            </p>
            <P>
                The "Fat Man" Bomb was a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon that used plutonium-239.
                This design used conventional explosives to compress a plutonium core into a supercritical state, which would initiate a nuclear explosion. 
                A total of ~120 "Fat Man" Bombs were produced between 1945 to 1949 before it was retired.

                The first ever atomic bomb to be used in war was in August 6, 1945, when the US dropped the Little boy on the japanese city of hiroshima.
                At approximately 2:45am on 6 August, a B-29 bomber "Enola Gay" took off from a runway in Tinnian Island with a deactivated "Little Boy" bomb.
                Almost 6 hours later at 8:15am, the "little boy" was dropped over Hiroshima, just as its residents were waking up.
                The bomb detonated at about 580 meters above ground level, instanly killing over 10 thousand people, with another 120 thousand dying soon after.
                It leveled two-thirds of the city with an estimated explosion force of 15 Kilotons.

                The second and last atomic bomb to be used in war was dropped on the japanese city of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.
                At approximately 3.47am, a B-29 bomber "Bockscar" took off from the same run way in Tinnian Island, also with a deactivated "Fat Man" bomb.
                About 7 hours later at 11:02am, the "Fat Man" bomb was dropped over Nagasaki, where it exploded 500 meters above the ground.
                40 thousand people were instantly killed, with at least 40 thousand more dying soon after. It leveled a portion of the city with an estimated explosion force of 21 kilotons.
