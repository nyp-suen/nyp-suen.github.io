                    <h1>Bread</h1>
                    <p>Bread is a staple food made from dough and water. It has been an important part of many people's
                        diets. It is one of humanity's oldest foods, has been important since the dawn of agriculture,
                        and plays an important role in religion and culture.</p>
                    <p>
                        Bread is fermented with natural microorganisms (such as sourdough), chemicals (such as baking
                        soda), industrial leavening, or high-pressure aeration, which creates gas bubbles that that
                        fluff up bread. In many countries, commercial bread often contains additives for taste, texture,
                        color, shelf life, nutrition and ease of preparation.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Etymology</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Old English word for bread was "hlaf" (or "hlaifs" in Gothic, which evolved into the modern
                        English word "loaf"), and it appears to be the oldest Teutonic name for bread. This
                        Proto-Germanic term gave rise to Old High German "hleib" and modern German "Laib". It was also
                        borrowed into several Slavic languages (e.g., Czech: "chléb", Polish: "bochen chleba", Russian:
                        "khleb") and Finnic languages (e.g., Finnish: "leipä", Estonian: "leib"). The words for bread in
                        Middle and Modern English ("bread") are found in other Germanic languages, such as West Frisian
                        ("brea"), Dutch ("brood"), German ("Brot"), Swedish ("bröd"), and Norwegian and Danish ("brød").
                        The term "bread" might be related to "brew" or possibly to "break", originally signifying
                        "broken piece" or "morsel".

                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p>
                        Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe and
                        Australia shows starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants. During this time, it is likely
                        that starch extracted from plant roots, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock,
                        placed over a fire, and cooked into a primitive flatbread. The earliest evidence of bread-making
                        comes from a 14,500-year-old Natufian site in northeastern Jordan. By around 10,000 BC, with the
                        advent of the Neolithic age and the spread of agriculture, grains became the primary ingredient
                        for making bread. Yeast spores, which are present everywhere, including on cereal grains, cause
                        any dough left to rest to leaven naturally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leavened bread was first baked around 6000 BC in southern Mesopotamia, the heart of Sumerian
                        civilization. The Sumerians may have shared this knowledge with the Egyptians around 3000 BC.
                        The Egyptians refined the process by adding yeast to the flour. Meanwhile, the Sumerians were
                        already using ash to enhance the dough during baking.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content3">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be
                        harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder
                        reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer, called barm, to produce "a
                        lighter kind of bread than other peoples" such as barm cake. Parts of the ancient world that
                        drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed to
                        begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in wine, as a source for yeast. The most common source
                        of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough
                        starter, as Pliny also reported.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans all considered the degree of refinement in the bakery
                        arts as a sign of civilization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Developed in 1961, the Chorleywood bread process utilizes intense mechanical working of dough to
                        significantly reduce both the fermentation period and the overall time needed to produce a loaf.
                        This high-energy mixing technique permits the use of grain with lower protein content and is now
                        widely adopted in large factories worldwide. Consequently, bread can be produced rapidly and at
                        low cost for both manufacturers and consumers. However, there has been some criticism regarding
                        its impact on nutritional value.

                        Doughs are typically baked, but in some cuisines, breads are prepared using different methods:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Steamed</li>

                        <li>Baked on a frying pan</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Bread can be either leavened or unleavened. Common ingredients include:
