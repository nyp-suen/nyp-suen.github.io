                    <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
                    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. <br>
                       The signs and symptoms may be mild or severe and usually appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. <br>
                        Some people may not have any symptoms but are still able to spread the virus. <br> 
                        Most people with COVID-19 recover without needing special treatment. But other people are at higher risk of serious illness. <br>
                        Those at higher risk include older adults and people with serious medical problems, such as heart, lung, or kidney disease, diabetes, cancer, or a weak immune system. <br>
                        Serious illness may include life-threatening pneumonia and organ failure. Research is being done to treat COVID-19 and to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. Also called coronavirus disease 19.
