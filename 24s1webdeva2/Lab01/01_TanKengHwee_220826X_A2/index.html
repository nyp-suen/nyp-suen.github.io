                            <p>First Robotic Arm is Installed on a Factory Floor
                            Known as Unimate, the first industrial robotic arm went to work in a General Motors plant, lifting and stacking hot, die-cut metal parts. Created by George Devol and his partner Joseph Engelberger, it could move up and down on the X and Y axis, possessed a rotatable, pincer-like gripper, and could follow a program of up to 200 movements stored in its memory. Deployable for numerous tasks, most particularly some that were too taxing or dangerous for humans — like lifting 75-pound loads without tiring and working amid toxic fumes — the Unimate began the transformation of the auto industry into an arena of widespread automation.
