									<p>Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, have evidence of oceans beneath their ice crusts.

									<p>Astronomers estimate that the universe could contain up to one septillion stars ‚Äì that‚Äôs a one followed by 24 zeros. Our Milky Way alone contains more than 100 billion, including our most well-studied star, the Sun.</p>
									<p>Stars are giant balls of hot gas ‚Äì mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. Every star has its own life cycle, ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties change as it ages.</p>

									<h2>1.</h2>
									<p>Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds. Molecular clouds range from 1,000 to 10 million times the mass of the Sun and can span as much as hundreds of light-years. Molecular clouds are cold which causes gas to clump, creating high-density pockets.</p>
									<p>Some of these clumps can collide with each other or collect more matter, strengthening their gravitational force as their mass grows. Eventually, gravity causes some of these clumps to collapse.</p>
									<p>When this happens, friction causes the material to heat up, which eventually leads to the development of a protostar ‚Äì a baby star. Batches of stars that have recently formed from molecular clouds are often called stellar clusters, and molecular clouds full of stellar clusters are called stellar nurseries.</p>

									<h2>2.</h2>
									<p>At first, most of the protostar‚Äôs energy comes from heat released by its initial collapse. </p>
									<p>After millions of years, immense pressures and temperatures in the star‚Äôs core squeeze the nuclei of hydrogen atoms together to form helium, a process called nuclear fusion.</p>
									<p>Nuclear fusion releases energy, which heats the star and prevents it from further collapsing under the force of gravity.</p>

							<div class="content-container">
								<section class="info-section info-right">
									<h2>3.</h2>
									<p>At the beginning of the end of a star‚Äôs life, its core runs out of hydrogen to convert into helium. The energy produced by fusion creates pressure inside the star that balances gravity‚Äôs tendency to pull matter together, so the core starts to collapse. But squeezing the core also increases its temperature and pressure, making the star slowly puff up. However, the details of the late stages of the star‚Äôs death depend strongly on its mass.</p>
									<p>A low-mass star‚Äôs atmosphere will keep expanding until it becomes a subgiant or giant star while fusion converts helium into carbon in the core. (This will be the fate of our Sun, in several billion years.) Some giants become unstable and pulsate, periodically inflating and ejecting some of their atmospheres. Eventually, all the star‚Äôs outer layers blow away, creating an expanding cloud of dust and gas called a planetary nebula.</p>

									<h2>Stellar Nebula</h2>
									<p>All stars form in nebulae, which are huge clouds of gas and dust. Though they shine for many thousands, and even millions of years, stars do not last forever. The changes that occur in a star over time and the final stage of its life depend on a star's size.</p>

									<h2>Average Star / Massive Star</h2>
									<p>Nuclear reactions at the centre (or core) of a star provides energy which makes it shine brightly. This stage is called the 'main sequence'. The exact lifetime of a star depends very much on its size. Very massive stars use up their fuel quickly. This means they may only last a few hundred thousand years. Smaller stars use up fuel more slowly so will shine for several billion years.</p>

									<h4>Black holes don‚Äôt emit or reflect light, making them effectively invisible to telescopes. Scientists primarily detect and study them based on how they affect their surroundings:</h4>
									<p>Black holes can be surrounded by rings of gas and dust, called accretion disks, that emit light across many wavelengths, including X-rays.</p>
									<p>A supermassive black hole‚Äôs intense gravity can cause stars to orbit around it in a particular way. Astronomers tracked the orbits of several stars near the center of the Milky Way to prove it houses a supermassive black hole, a discovery that won the 2020 Nobel Prize.</p>
									<p>When very massive objects accelerate through space, they create ripples in the fabric of space-time called gravitational waves. Scientists can detect some of these by the ripples‚Äô effect on detectors.</p>
									<p>Massive objects like black holes can bend and distort light from more distant objects. This effect, called gravitational lensing, can be used to find isolated black holes that are otherwise invisible.</p>

									<p>Black holes are not Wormholes. They don‚Äôt provide shortcuts between different points in space, or portals to other dimensions or universes.</p>
									<p>Black holes are not Cosmic Vacuum Cleaners. Black holes don‚Äôt suck in other matter. From far enough away, their gravitational effects are just like those of other objects of the same mass.</p>
