                    In order for Singapore to power the homes and facilities of its citizens, the country
                    relies on multiple sources to produce or obtain electrical energy. Interact with the

                            just like the 60 megawatt-peak floating solar photovoltaic system at Tengah Reservoir,
                            which is equivalent to 45 football fields in size.

                            plants. The waste is stored in large refuse bunkers before being fed to incinerators
                            which operate at temperatures of between 850 and 1,000 degrees Celsius. Steam generated from
                            the heat will drives steam turbine generators in WTE plants to produce electricity. Learn more

                            Since Singapore has no crude oil deposits,the country imports it for refining and petrochemical industries.
                            Over two-thirds of Singapore’s crude oil imports come from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait.
                            Most of Singapore’s refined petroleum product and petrochemical are exported to neighboring Asian countries.

                        <p>
                            According to Singapore's Green Plan, the aim is to deploy at least 2 gigawatt-peak worth of
                            solar panels by the year 2030. The amount of energy generated from this is enough to meet the
                            yearly electrical needs of around 350K households.

                        <h3>Decarbonising The Power Sector</h3>
                        <p>
                            According to the Energy Market Authority, power generation accounts for about 40% of Singapore’s 
                            emissions as of 1st March 2024, with 95% of electricity being generated from natural gas. To decarbonise 
                            the power sector, Singapore will import electricity from other countries like Malaysia and explore low-carbon 
                            alternatives such as hydrogen.

                            Singapore has long-term agreements with neighbouring countries to start importing lower-carbon electricity. For
                            example on September 8th 2023, conditional approval was given by Singapore's Energy Market Authority for the import
                            of 2 GigaWatt of electricity from Indonesia. Companies including keppel Energy will begin to import 300 megawatts of it
                            at the target start date of 2027 through a shared subsea transmission cable system.
