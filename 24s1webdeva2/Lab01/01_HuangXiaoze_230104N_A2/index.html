                                unique preparation. It involves finely ground coffee beans mixed with cold water and
                                sugar, if desired, in a special pot called a cezve. The mixture is slowly heated until
                                it froths but doesn’t boil. Served in small cups, Turkish coffee is enjoyed without
                                stirring, allowing grounds to settle at the bottom.

                                Mocha is a coffee drink that combines espresso with chocolate syrup or cocoa powder and
                                steamed milk. It’s typically topped with whipped cream and sometimes drizzled with
                                additional chocolate.

                                The mocha’s distinctive taste comes from the harmonious blend of rich, robust coffee and

                                indulgent coffee experience. It can be enjoyed in various forms, including hot, iced, or
                                blended, and is often customized with different types of chocolate or flavored syrups.

                        <p>Coffee is a popular beverage made from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries
                            from the Coffea plant. Native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, coffee
                            plants are now cultivated in various countries around the world, with Brazil, Vietnam, and
                            Colombia being some of the largest producers.</p>

                                    which makes it richer and more intense than drip coffee, but it actually has less
