          <small>Over 400 million years ago</small>
          <p>
            Silurian Period: The earliest shark-like fossils date back to the Silurian period, over 420 million years ago. These early sharks were primitive and quite different from modern sharks.<br>
            Devonian Period (419-359 million years ago): Known as the "Age of Fishes," this period saw the diversification of early sharks, which evolved into more distinct forms and began to resemble the sharks we know today.

          <p>
            Mesozoic Era: During the Mesozoic era, particularly in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, modern sharks began to emerge. The Heterodontiformes (bullhead sharks) and Lamniformes (mackerel sharks) are examples of shark orders that appeared during this time.

          <p>
            Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction Event: Sharks survived the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs around 66 million years ago. This extinction event led to the decline of many marine predators, allowing sharks to dominate the oceans.
