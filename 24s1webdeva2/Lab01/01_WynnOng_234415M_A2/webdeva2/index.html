                    Ando was convicted of tax evasion in 1948 and served two years in jail. In his biography, Ando said
                    he had provided scholarships for students, which at the time was a form of tax evasion. After he
                    lost his company due to a chain-reaction bankruptcy, Ando founded what was to become Nissin in
                    Ikeda, Osaka, Japan, starting off as a small family-run company producing salt.

                    With Japan still suffering from a shortage of food in the post-war era, the Ministry of Health tried
                    to
                    encourage people to eat bread made from wheat flour that was supplied by the United States. Ando
                    wondered why bread was recommended instead of noodles, which were more familiar to the Japanese. The
                    Ministry's response was that noodle companies were too small and unstable to satisfy supply needs,
                    so
                    Ando decided to develop the production of noodles by himself. The experience convinced him that
                    "Peace
                    will come to the world when the people have enough to eat."

                <p>On August 25, 1958, at the age of 48, and after months of trial and error experimentation to perfect
                    his flash-frying method, Ando marketed the first package of precooked instant noodles. The original
                    chicken flavor is called Chikin Ramen. It was originally considered a luxury item with its price of
                    ¥35 (US$0.10) in 1958 under the then exchange rate of 360 yen to the dollar but equivalent to
                    ¥608 by 2021 or US$5.69 under the current exchange rate of US$1 =¥106.775 in around six times
                    that of traditional udon and soba noodles at the time. As of 2016, Chicken Ramen is still sold in
                    Japan and now retails for around ¥120 (US$1.12), or approximately one-third the price of the
                    cheapest bowl of noodles in a Japanese restaurant.</p>

                <p>
                    According to The Financial Times, Ando's invention of Cup Noodles in 1971, at the age of 61, helped
                    spark the popularity of instant noodles overseas. He had observed that Americans ate noodles by
                    breaking the noodles in half, putting them into a paper cup, and pouring hot water over the noodles.
                    They also ate them with a fork instead of chopsticks. Ando was inspired, and felt that a Styrofoam
                    cup—with a narrower bottom than the top—would be the ideal vessel for holding noodles and keeping
                    them warm. Eating the noodles would then be as easy as opening the lid, adding hot water and
                    waiting. This simplicity, efficiency and low price of Cup Noodles went on to transform Nissin's
                    fortunes.
                </p>
                <p> Ando began the sales of his most famous product, Cup Noodle (カップヌードル, Kappu Nūdoru), on September
                    18, 1971, with the idea of providing a waterproof polystyrene container. As prices dropped, instant
                    ramen soon became a booming business. Worldwide demand reached 98 billion servings in 2009.
