                    <h3>Great White Shark</h3>
                    <p>The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white, 
                        is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. 
                        It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon. The great white shark is notable for its size, 
                        with the largest preserved female specimen measuring 5.83 m (19.1 ft) in length and around 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) in weight at maturity. 
                        However, most are smaller; males measure 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft), and females measure 4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on average.
                        According to a 2014 study, the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, 
                        well above previous estimates, making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fishes currently known. According to the same study, 
                        male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring. 
                        Great white sharks can swim at speeds of 25 km/h (16 mph)[9] for short bursts and to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft)</p>

                    <h3>Tiger Shark</h3>
                    <p>The basking shark is a cosmopolitan migratory species found in all the world's temperate oceans. A slow-moving filter feeder, 
                        its common name derives from its habit of feeding at the surface, appearing to be basking in the warmer water there. 
                        It has anatomical adaptations for filter-feeding, such as a greatly enlarged mouth and highly developed gill rakers. 
                        Its snout is conical, and the gill slits extend around the top and bottom of its head. The gill rakers, dark and bristle-like, 
                        are used to catch plankton as water filters through the mouth and over the gills. 
                        The teeth are numerous and very small and often number 100 per row. The teeth have a single conical cusp, 
                        are curved backwards and are the same on both the upper and lower jaws. This species has the smallest weight-for-weight brain size of any shark, 
                        reflecting its relatively passive lifestyle.Typically, basking sharks reach 7.9 m (26 ft) in length. It is usually greyish-brown, 
                        with mottled skin, with the inside of the mouth being white in colour. </p>

                    <h3>Hammerhead Shark</h3>
                    <p>The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks that form the family Sphyrnidae, named for the unusual and distinctive form of their heads, 
                        which are flattened and laterally extended into a cephalofoil (a T-shape or "hammer"). 
                        The shark's eyes are placed one on either end of this T-shaped structure, with their small mouths directly centered and underneath. 
                        Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna, while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra. 
                        Many different‚Äî but not necessarily mutually exclusive‚Äîfunctions have been postulated for the cephalofoil, 
                        including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. The cephalofoil gives the shark superior binocular vision and depth perception.
                        The known species range from 0.9 to 6.0 m (2 ft 11 in to 19 ft 8 in) in length and weigh 3‚Äì580 kg (6.6‚Äì1,300 lb).</p>

                    <h3>Whale shark </h3>
                    <p>The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species. 
                        The largest confirmed individual had a length of 18.8 m (61.7 ft). The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom, 
                        most notably being by far the most massive living non-cetacean animal. 
                        It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae, 
                        which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. 
                        Before 1984 it was classified as Rhiniodon into Rhinodontidae.</p>

            <h2>Feeding</h2>

            <div id="feeding">
                <p>
                    Most sharks are carnivorous. Basking sharks, whale sharks, 
                    and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: 
                    basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, 
                    and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths 
                    to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers‚Äîlong, 
                    slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve‚Äîanalogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. 
                    The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls. 
                    Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Other highly specialized feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. 
                    Cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. 
                    Although they have never been observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, 
                    twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.

                <p>
                    Some seabed‚Äìdwelling species are highly effective ambush predators. 
                    Angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths. 
                    Many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Other sharks feed on squid or fish, which they swallow whole. 
                    The viper dogfish has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. 
                    The great white and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. 
                    Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, 
                    and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.

                <h2>Introduction to Sharks</h2>
            </div>
            
            <p id="introduction">
                Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton,
                five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the
                head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are
                the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and kin). Some sources extend the term "shark" as
                an informal category including extinct members of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish)
                with a shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans such as
                Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the Devonian Period (419‚Äì359 million
                years), though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late
                Ordovician (458‚Äì444 million years ago). The earliest confirmed modern sharks
                (selachimorphs) are known from the Early Jurassic around 200 million years ago, with
                the oldest known member being Agaleus, though records of true sharks may extend
                back as far as the Permian.

            <p>
                Sharks range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), 
                a deep sea species that is only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, 
                to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, 
                which reaches approximately 12 metres (40 ft) in length. 
                They are found in all seas and are common to depths up to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). 
                They generally do not live in freshwater, although there are a few known exceptions, 
                such as the bull shark and the river sharks, which can be found in both seawater and freshwater, 
                and the Ganges shark, which lives only in freshwater. 
                Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in 
                addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.
