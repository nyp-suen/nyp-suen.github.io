            <h1>About Sushi</h1>
            <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi] ⓘ) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared 
                rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, plus a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), 
                such as vegetables, and any meat, but most commonly seafood (often raw but can be cooked). Styles of sushi 
                and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), 
                or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]

                The creator of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, 
                a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice,
                around 1824 in the Edo period (1603–1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.cimus.

                In 1958, Yoshiaki Shiraishi opened the first conveyor belt sushi restaurant (回転寿司, kaiten-zushi) named "Genroku Zushi" in Higashi-Osaka. In conveyor belt sushi restaurants, conveyor belts installed along tables and counters in the restaurant transport plates of
                 sushi to customers. Generally, the bill is based on the number of plates, with different colored plates representing the price of the sushi.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The history of sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) began with paddy fields, 
                where fish was fermented with vinegar, salt and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The earliest form of the dish, 
                today referred to as narezushi, was created in Japan around the Yayoi period (early Neolithic–early Iron Age). In the Muromachi 
                period (1336–1573), people began to eat the rice as well as the fish.
                During the Edo period (1603–1867), vinegar rather than fermented rice began to be used.

            <p>
                The earliest form of sushi, a dish today known as narezushi, originated in Southeast Asia where it was made to preserve freshwater fish, 
                possibly in the Mekong River basin, which is now Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, and in the Irrawaddy River basin, which is now Myanmar.
                Narezushi in ancient China is first documented around the 4th century, when the Han Chinese migrated south to adopt this food from the Baiyue
                (the original non-Han inhabitants of southern China in the Neolithic, related to modern Southeast Asians).
