        Visual Impairments can come in many forms.<br>All the term means is any kind of vision loss, including your common Myopia (short-sightedness), which is present in 83% of young adults in Singapore.<br>
        <br>But most people understand the milder kinds.<br>
        <br>The ones people misunderstand are the more severe ones. Case in point: Blindness
        <br>Blindness ranges in causes, symptoms and severity.
        <br>Generally, it is categorized into 3 types:

                <br>Complete loss of vision and NO perception of light.
                <br>
                <br>The stereotypical form of blindness people assume the term automatically refers to.
                <br>In reality, only about 15% of blind people suffer total blindness.
                <br>This is, of course, the most severe and extreme version of blindness of all, and there are people in the world who unfortunately suffer from this.

                <br>Partial Blindness, also known as "low vision", refers to any eye condition that reduces your range of vision.
                <br>There are several eye conditions that cause this, here are some examples:

                    <br>
                    <br>Legal Blindness is a term that can also be applied to Partial Blindness, but it mostly refers to vision with an extremely high degree, 20/200 or worse.
                    <br>The difference between this and regular short or long-sightedness is that it only counts if it cannot be corrected by anything like glasses or contact lenses.
                    <br>Legal Blindness also applies if your field of vision is less than 20 degrees.
