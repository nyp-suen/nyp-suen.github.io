                    The arrow has a notch or nock at the end that must be appropriately cliped on the bow
                    string and placed on the knocking point where the arrow shaft sits before pulling.
                    Grip the bow at the bottom limb slightly below the arrow. Once the setup is done,
                    the bowstring can then be pulled with 3 fingers either just below the arrow or
                    a single index finger on top with the rest below.
                    <br><br>
                    Pull the bowstring with consistency where you do not have to use too much strength
                    and can remain aiming with stable stright arm, if the bow is too heavy,
                    get a lighter bow. Once the bowstring is pulled, it can be aimed before
                    firing, each bow may have a slight different way of setting up and aiming.
