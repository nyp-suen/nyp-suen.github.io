            <h1>History of Canoe Sprint</h1>
        
            <a>Canoe sprint is a sport in which athletes race canoes (C) or kayaks (K) 
                on a flatwater course. In a canoe, paddlers use a single-bladed paddle 
                in high-kneel position whereas in a kayak, paddlers use a double-bladed 
                paddle in a seated position. Canoeing is the common name given to these 
                two distinct categories of kayak and canoe.</a>
        
            <br>
            <br>

            <a>At the international level, 
                the discipline is competed over four distances from 200m to 5000m, 
                both individually and in teams of up to four. 
                Each discipline is categorized by boat type, 
                number of competitors per boat, gender and race distance, 
                meaning the example of MC2 500m is the Men Canoe Doubles 500m.</a>

            <br>
            <br>

            <a>The first recognized canoeing competition was held in 1869 
                and it was organized by John MacGregor, 
                the founder of the British Royal Canoe Club (RCC). 
                Its popularity started to grow in Europe and America 
                and soon trans-Atlantic competition commenced with the 
                founding of the New York Canoe Club. 
                The first womenâ€™s competition was also organized in Russia, 
                and by the 1890s, canoe sport was very popular and 
                had a large following in Europe. The next milestone for the 
                sport was its inclusion as an Olympic discipline and it debuted 
                at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games.</a>

            <br>
            <br>

            <a>In Singapore, the Singapore Canoe Federation (SCF) is the 
                National Sports Association (NSA) overseeing canoe sprint and 
                its popularity as a sport has grown immensely since 1971.  
                To support this growing community, SCF conducts coaching courses 
                for aspiring individuals who wish to pursue coaching. 
                Regular competitions organized provides a platform for individuals 
                of varying interest levels and proficiency to test themselves or 
                simply enjoy the sport.</a>

            <br>
            <br>

            <a>SCF is also in charge of the Singapore National Canoe/Kayak Sprint Team 
                that represents Singapore at regional and international competitions 
                such as the South East Asian Games (SEA Games), 
                Asian Games and World Championships.
                Athletes are qualified for the National Team based on selection time 
                trials and results at the national canoe sprint events, with 
                recommendations from the national coaches. In recent years, our 
                athletes have performed well at regional games, winning 5 Golds and 
                7 Silvers at the 2015 South East Asian Games, and the first ever canoe 
                sprint medal, a bronze, at the 2018 Asian Games.</a>

            <br>
            <br>

            <a>The SCF is committed to the development of paddlers in Singapore 
                and we hope that our athletes will be able to maximize their potential 
                in this sport.</a>
