                    Paper is a thin nonwoven material traditionally made from a combination of 
                    milled plant and textile fibres. The first paper-like plant-based writing sheet 
                    was papyrus in Egypt, but the first true papermaking process was documented in China 
                    during the Eastern Han period (25â€“220 AD), traditionally attributed to the court official Cai Lun.

            <p>You will start by turning the raw material into pulp which then be refined by placing the pulp in a 
            mechnical mechine which uses rotating discs or bars. By refining the pulp, it helps to give the paper better
            characteristics such as fiber length, strength, and flexibility. Once refining is done, it will be put into a mesh to
            let the water drain off so that the fibers can bind together into a wet slab of paper which will be presed and dired and produce the paper that we use.
