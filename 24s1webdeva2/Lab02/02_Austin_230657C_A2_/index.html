            <p>A <a class = "external_link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano" target = "_blank">piano</a> is a versatile and expressive <a class = "external_link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument" target = "_blank">musical instrument</a> that produces sound through the striking of strings by hammers, which are activated by pressing keys on a keyboard. It features 88 keys, spanning over seven octaves, allowing for a wide range of notes and complex musical compositions. The piano's structure includes a soundboard that amplifies the vibrations of the strings, giving the instrument its rich and resonant tone. With its dynamic range, the piano can produce everything from soft, delicate melodies to powerful, thunderous chords. This combination of technical precision and emotional depth has made the piano a cornerstone of both classical and contemporary music.</p>

Originally called the <em>"gravicembalo col piano e forte,"</em> meaning "harpsichord with soft and loud," the piano evolved from earlier keyboard instruments like the <a class = "external_link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavichord" target = "_blank">clavichord</a> and <a class = "external_link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpsichord" target = "_blank">harpsichord</a>. Over the centuries, the piano underwent significant innovations, including the development of the modern grand and upright pianos, improvements in string and hammer mechanisms, and the expansion of its tonal range. Today, the piano remains a cornerstone of Western music, celebrated for its versatility and expressive capabilities.</p>

            <p>The piano's functionalities are defined by its intricate mechanism, which allows for a wide range of musical expression. When a key is pressed, a felt-covered hammer strikes strings inside the piano, producing sound. The force with which the key is struck affects the volume and tone, enabling dynamic play from soft, gentle notes to powerful, resonant chords. The three pedals—soft (una corda), sostenuto, and damper—further enhance the instrument's versatility by modifying the sound and sustaining notes. Together, these elements allow pianists to create complex and nuanced musical performances.</p>
