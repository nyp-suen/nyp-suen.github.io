                <p>A turtle is a reptile that has a shell covering its body. Turtles are known for moving very slowly.
                    There are more than 350 species, or types, of turtle. <br><br>
                    Turtles are found in most parts of the world. Most live in freshwater ponds, lakes, or rivers.
                    Others live in the ocean or on land. Some turtles live in forests or even in the desert. Land
                    turtles are often
                    called tortoises. Some water turtles are known as terrapins.<br><br>
                    Turtles are all different sizes. The smallest turtles are less than 4 inches (10 centimeters) long.
                    In contrast, the Atlantic leatherback turtle can be more than 7 feet (2 meters) long.
                    It can weigh more than 1,500 pounds (680 kilograms).<br><br>
                    Turtles have sturdy legs with short feet and claws on the toes.
                    Sea turtles have flippers instead of front feet. A turtle’s shell is made of bone.
                    It is usually very hard and strong. Most turtles can tuck the head, legs, and tail inside the shell
                    for protection
                    from enemies. Snapping turtles cannot do this, but they have a powerful bite for
                    protection.<br><br>
                    Turtles eat worms, snails, insects, jellyfish, and shellfish. Many tortoises eat only plants.
                    Turtles can store food in the form of fat. Some turtles can store water, too.
                    They can live for days or even weeks without having anything to eat or drink.<br><br>
                    All turtles lay their eggs on land. The female digs a hole and lays her eggs in it.
                    The temperature in the nest usually affects the sex of the baby turtles.
                    Warmer temperatures generally produce females, while cooler temperatures produce males.<br><br>
                    Turtles live longer than most other animals. Some species can live more than 100 years.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="p2Item2">
                <p>Turtles should eat commercially available turtle pellets (which include required protein for their
                    health)
                    in addition to live food and a variety of vegetables. Turtles can even enjoy the occasional fruit or
                    treat!<br>
                    Each individual turtle’s diet should be thoroughly considered and researched based on the natural
                    diet of the species
                    and in coordination with a reptile veterinarian.</p>

                <p>
                    Most semiaquatic and aquatic turtles, such as red eared sliders, painted turtles, and pond turtles,
                    are omnivores.
                    This means they eat a combination of animal protein and vegetables. Omnivorous turtles should eat a
                    mixture of
                    multiple commercially produced turtle pellets, along with approved vegetables and plant
                    matter.<br>
                    Some species, such as the spiny soft-shell turtle, are considered carnivorous and eat primarily
                    animal protein.
                    Carnivorous turtles should eat a pellet mixture in addition to live animal protein.<br>
                    Typically, aquatic turtles eat more animal protein when they are young and more veggies as they get
                    older.
                    It’s important to continue to evolve your turtle’s diet as they age.</p>

            <div class="p2Item6">
                <p>
                    Many companies offer commercially available pellets for turtles.
                    It could be beneficial to rotate different brands of pellets, so your turtle is exposed to multiple
                    varieties
                    to determine which they prefer. Many of these diets are nutritionally complete and can meet the
                    nutritional
                    needs including vitamins, minerals and micronutrients for aquatic turtles.</p>

                <h1>What Animals Do Turtles Eat?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="p2Item8">
                <p>Live food is an important source of protein for both carnivorous and omnivorous turtles. Carnivorous
                    turtles will eat a higher percentage of live protein in addition to a variety of
                    pellets.<br><br>
                    Common live prey items include:<br><br>
                    - Feeder fish, such as goldfish, guppies, bait minnows, and smelt<br>
                    - Insects, such as earthworms, waxworms, mealworms, and bee moth larvae<br>
                    - Shellfish<br>
                    - Brine shrimp<br>
                    - Slugs<br>
                    - Snails<br><br>
                    Dead fish should be removed from the aquarium immediately, as they can foul the water and increase
                    bacteria in the water.</p>

            <div class="p2Item10">
                <p>Vegetables are often overlooked as part turtle food, but they should make up most of an adult
                    omnivorous turtle’s diet.<br><br>
                    Offer a wide variety of dark, leafy greens in addition to other vegetables. A turtle should never
                    eat the same vegetables their entire life. This can lead to nutritional deficiencies or other
                    diseases. Instead, offer two to three types of greens each feeding and one to two other
                    veggies.<br><br>
                    Highly nutritious vegetable sources for turtles include:<br><br>
                    - Collard greens<br>
                    - Mustard greens<br>
                    - Dandelion greens<br>
                    - Kale<br>
                    - Romaine<br>
                    - Swiss chard<br>
                    - Watercress<br>
                    - Endive<br>
                    - Bok choy<br>
                    - Escarole<br>
                    - Spinach<br>
                    - Duckweed<br>
                    - Shredded carrots and carrot tops<br>
                    - Squash<br>
                    - Green beans<br>
                    - Broccoli<br>
                    - Aquatic plants sold at aquarium stores (ensure they are specifically sold for aquatic
                    pets)<br><br>

                <p>Some turtles may enjoy occasional fruit as well. Fruit should be offered raw. Cut or shred any fruits
                    to help with swallowing and prevent choking. To help keep a turtle’s beak trim, you can offer pieces
                    of cantaloupe with the rind still attached.<br><br>
                    Some common turtle favorites include:<br><br>

                <p>
                    Turtles have adapted to a remarkable variety of environments, but the greatest number of species
                    occur in southeastern
                    North America and South Asia. In both areas, most species are aquatic, living in bodies of water
                    ranging from small ponds
                    and bogs to large lakes and rivers. A few are strictly terrestrial (tortoises), and others divide
                    their time between land
                    and water. Although turtles as a group are broadly distributed, each species has a preferred habitat
                    and is seldom found
                    elsewhere. For example, both the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) and the Eastern box turtle
                    (Terrapene carolina)
                    live in the southern United States and are equally terrestrial, but they are not usually found
                    together, as the box
                    turtle prefers moist forest and the gopher tortoise open woodlands on sand ridges. The eastern mud
                    turtle
                    (Kinosternon subrubrum) is commonly considered an aquatic turtle, yet it spends the summer months in
                    dormancy,
                    estivating beneath vegetation in woodlands adjacent to its pond and stream habitats. The alligator
                    snapping turtle
                    (Macrochelys temmincki) lives in the deep, slow-moving streams and backwaters of the U.S. Gulf
                    Coast. Map turtles
                    (Graptemys), on the other hand, select the faster-flowing waters of those same streams. The
                    saltwater terrapin
                    (Malaclemys terrapin) lives in brackish coastal estuaries and marshes from Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
                    to Padre Island,
                    Texas. In some instances, juvenile sea turtles share these estuaries; larger and older sea turtles
                    swim offshore in
                    coastal waters to the mid-continental shelf.
