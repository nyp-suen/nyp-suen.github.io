                <h3>Steamed Chicken</h3>
                <p>Steamed Chicken is a simple and healthy dish that involves cooking chicken through steaming, which helps retain its natural flavors and nutrients. The chicken, often a whole bird or pieces such as breasts or thighs, is usually seasoned with ingredients like ginger, garlic, green onions, and soy sauce. Steaming the chicken results in tender, juicy meat with a subtle, clean taste. This method of cooking is particularly popular in Asian cuisines, where the steamed chicken is often served with a flavorful dipping sauce made from soy sauce, sesame oil, and other seasonings. It's a light and nutritious dish that highlights the pure taste of the chicken.</p>

                <p>Roasted Chicken is a classic dish that involves cooking a whole chicken in an oven. The chicken is often marinated or seasoned with a blend of herbs, spices, and sometimes citrus or garlic, to enhance its flavor.

Roasted chicken can be served as a main course and is often accompanied by side dishes like roasted vegetables, potatoes, or rice. It is a versatile and widely enjoyed dish in many cuisines around the world.</p>

                <ul>
                    <!-- List of ingredients for Rice -->
                    <li>2 cups of Long grain rice</li>

                    <li>2 Tbsp of Chicken fat with skin attached – obtained by trimming excess fat from Chicken</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp of Water</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Recipe:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <!-- Step-by-step recipe instructions -->
                    <li>Trim off any excess fat and skin from the chicken and keep it aside (this will be used for the rice in Step 2). The next thing to do is to “exfoliate“! Exfoliating the chicken helps remove any trapped dirt or yucky stuff off the skin. Grab a handful of coarse or kosher salt and start rubbing all over the skin but at the same time being careful not to tear or damage the skin. You should see a smooth clean skin once completed. The next step is to give your chicken a workout! There is a theory that when most chickens are “killed“, their muscles tend to tense up and constrict. By giving the legs and wings gentle pulls and stretches, it should ease the muscle tension and thus give you a more juicy and tender soft flesh at the end.</li>
                    <li>Combine the Honey, Maltose, Molasses, Five spice powder, White pepper, Ginger juice, and Light soy sauce in a bowl. Stir to mix the marinade and generously rub all over the chicken including the cavity. Stuff the Spring onions and Ginger slices into the cavity. Tie the two legs together with kitchen twine to help cover the cavity. Leave the marinated chicken to air dry in the refrigerator for at least 6-8 hours or overnight.</li>
                    <li>Take the chicken out 30-45 mins before roasting to allow it to reach room temperature. Preheat oven to 220 degrees Celsius. When the oven is hot enough, turn it down to 200 degrees Celsius and place the roasting pan with chicken into the oven for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, reduce the heat to 180 degrees Celsius and roast for a further 30-45 minutes (depending on the size of the chicken) until the skin is crisp and dark brown in color. Once done, take the chicken out to rest before cutting it into pieces.</li>

                <p>Char Siew is a popular Chinese dish that features barbecued pork. It is known for its distinctive flavor and appearance, typically characterized by a sweet, savory, and slightly smoky taste.

                <ol>
                    <!-- Step-by-step recipe instructions -->
                    <li>Wash and drain dry chicken thighs. Slice lightly on the veins to break it, so the chicken meat will not roll up while cooking and for better texture too.</li>
                    <li>Marinate the chicken with light soy sauce, rice wine, cornstarch, grated garlic, grated ginger, and salt to taste. Mix and massage the ingredients so that they get better absorption by the meat. Transfer to the chiller and let it sit for 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine sauce mixture ingredients and mix well. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Transfer chicken out from the chiller at least ½ hour before cooking.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle some oil in the pan, add chicken thighs in and pan-fry till golden brown and slightly charred. Add in sauce mixture and stir to mix. Cover and let it braise for a few minutes until the sauce thickens and dries up.</li>
                    <li>Add in honey last, just to give a final coat to the chicken. This gives the chicken a shiny glaze and a hint of honey sweetness.</li>
