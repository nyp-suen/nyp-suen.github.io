      An eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth such that, when viewed from a certain location, the Sun gets blocked out by the Moon, casting a shadow onto the Earth. <br><br>

      The shadow cast by the Moon is made of two cones. <br>
      Viewers within the dark inner shadow, called the umbra, will see the Moon directly covering the Sun, resulting in a sight similar to the one in the background of this page. This is known as a total solar eclipse. <br>
      Viewers within the lighter outer shadow, called the penumbra, will only see the Sun partially blocked. This is called a partial solar eclipse.

      Eclipses, being rare and mystifying events, often had stories and legends surrounding them from different cultures all over the world. <br>
      Many of such myths involved some kind of divine entity devouring the Sun in order to explain the phenomenon of the Sun suddenly being blotted out.<br><br>

      In Javanese mythology, it is the god of darkness, Batara Kala that does so. In response, Javanese villagers would offer sacrifices and beat drums in order to appease the god and make them release the Sun.<br><br>

      The only time you can safely look at the Sun without eye protection is during the period of a total solar eclipse when the Sun is completely blocked out by the Moon. Otherwise, looking at the Sun without eye protection will likely cause damage to your eyes.<br><br>
      
      Looking at an eclipse through a camera, binoculars or a telescope either. The solar rays will burn through the filter and damage your eyes.

      Your best bet is using eclipse glasses or an indirect method like a pinhole projector.
